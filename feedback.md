## Feedback Assignment 02

7/15

### Karaoke Game

The game does not really work, we've found several issues:

- crashes on start
- high latency
- not working robustly: see code comments

+1 for frequency detection working after major fixes
+1 for game (score, nice looking)

### Whistle Input

- crashes on start (-0.5)
- works not robustly (-1)
- high latency (-1)
- duplicate code for key input and whiste input (no bonus point)
- key input does not stop after the first input (-0.5)
